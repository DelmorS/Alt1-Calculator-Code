# Alt1 Calculator Dark
This is a Dark version of Alt1 Calculator, initially created by [Wally Cloud](https://sourceforge.net/u/wallycloud/profile/).

Alt1 is a lightweight, minimalist and full featured scientific calculator for windows. Whether you're doing simple calculations or solving a complex problem; the Alt1 calculator will always be by your side.

Input is solely via the keyboard and operation is as fast and user friendly as a physical calculator. The calculator lives in the system tray so it's always there when you need it. Just click the icon or hit the convenient hotkey (Alt + 1).

Calculations are evaluated in real time; there is no equals button. All your equations and answers are stored for later use so you can refer or edit them at anytime. Even better yet, editing previous equations instantly updates subsequent dependent answers.

## Features
* Real time calculations
* A wide range of operators (sin, cos, average, etc.)
* Full equation/answer history
* Seamless integration with Windows
* Engineered for ease of use
